# Carlos-Challenge-14-Tech-Blog

The purpose of this application is to create a tech blog site where users can login/signup, create posts, and comment on other users posts. This was developed with the use of MVC paradigm, MySQL, Handlebars, and other previous material. Although the code still isnt finished yet since I still have to the CSS, handlebars, and other parts of the application.
